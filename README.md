# MikesTapWavTools

This repository contains source code for two Windows tools. The tools are used to process/create "wav" and "tap" files, which are in turn used to transfer data and software to/from the Camputers Lynx computer (~or via a Lynx emulator such as: Jynx by Jonanthan Markland; or PALE by Peter Todd).

For information about the tools themselves, and to download the Windows Installer, please visit this website: http://retrowiki.es/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=200036021

This is a repository containing Visual Studio 2015 source code for the tools and the associated Windows installer program.

The tools are written in C# using Visual Studio Community 2015, and require the Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.
